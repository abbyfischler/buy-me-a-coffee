# Buy Me A Coffee! :coffee:

As some of you may already know, I just opened my buymeacoffee site, where any of you can contribute either becoming a member or buying the developer a coffee.

At first I was reluctant to open a funding page, but since some people that have contacted me for any open source related issues asking me how could they contribute or if I had any page where they could donate or help me in any way for my hard work, after some time thinking about it I decided that the best site that fitted with me and the content I want to provide you all, was buymeacoffee.

buymeacoffee is a website that contacts developers, designers, artists, etc. with their communities so that people can contribute and help them out so that the content they offer is better since the rewarding system encourages creators to continue doing what they like and helping others.

If you can contribute or you want to, feel free to do it at [__Buy me a coffee! :coffee:__](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/alvarobartt), I will be really thankfull for anything even if it is a membership, a coffee or just a kind comment towards my work, because that helps me a lot.

## Rewards

When you contribute with a donation, I will read your message and it will be shown in my main site.

Also, note that there is a membership available, where you can contribute with 5€/month or 50€/year and be part of a private community with some nice rewards such as:

* You’ll be notified by email when new members-only posts are published.
* Support me on a monthly basis.
* You can request new features on the current open source projects.
* You can ask me for any piece of advice and programming related tasks or doubts.
* You will be invited to my private Discord server where we can share content and discuss.
* I will include you in the credits of open source projects I develop while you are contributing.
* ... and much more to come!

## Special Offers

Since I just started this, I wanted to give the first 5 members a 30% off their yearly subscription, so to thank you in some way. Note that this special offer ends in 14 days from the day I am publishing this (May 5th), so hurry up if you want to take advantage of this offer.

* [Newcomers - 30% Off](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/alvarobartt?offer=newcomers)

### Be careful and donate just if it is within your possibilities, because there is no refund system. And remember you don't need to donate, it is just a free choice for you. Thank you!
